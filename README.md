# CyberWatch32
A digital watch made with a custom curcuit board and the STM32L0. Made to push the limits of low power wearable technology and my hardware skills

#The Original Project
This project originally started out as a very different project with the same goal. I started out with the CH32 Microprocessor, otherwise known as the 10 cent microcontroller. The first draft of this project used a real time clock, a 128px OLED display and the CH32. This would work in theory, but with the very limited RAM of the CH32 I was either going to have to get better at programming, or change the hardware.

The second revision changed
